# Disciple Tools List Export
The purpose of this project is to create additional exports on the list/filter pages (Contacts) which would allow you to
build a list click a button that would trigger a BCC email in your email client, map all listed contacts on a mapbox map,
export the list of emails and phone numbers to csv, and display a block of phone numbers that you can copy and paste into
your message app (iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal)
